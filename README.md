# miniproject Shaked Shimony 318663051

This is my mini-project in a workshop of data science for neuroscience.

# Installation

To run the project you need to download the following libraries:

* numpy
* matplotlib.pyplot
* seaborn
* pandas
* plotly.express

# Usage

You will find an analysis of the data according to the questions asked.

# Please note

The charts created using the plotly.express library are not visible in Git in "preview" due to their complexity. To see the graphs, you must run the project's code.
